# Mirage Tweaks

Lets you tweak Assassin's Creed Mirage in various ways. Currently supports adjusting the eject height and sprint speed.

## Usage

Get the [latest release](https://github.com/assassinscreedcommunity/Mirage-Tweaks/releases/latest) and run the tool
while Assassin's Creed Mirage is running. Then adjust the variables to your liking, effect should take place
immediately.

Note that closing either the tool or the game will reset the effect, requiring you to run the tool again.

## Credits

This project was made possible thanks to the work
of [Jintohaku](https://www.nexusmods.com/assassinscreedmirage/users/26200994), who made the original AC Mirage Eject
Height mod.
